            <b>Book review</b> <br /><br />

            The first book in the Malazan series To write a full review of
            gardens of the moon, I would have to had read the whole ten book
            series, as the white demon that made this book is also an
            archeologist, and he wrote this series in a way that one would have
            to gradually uncover the story as the books go on with minimal
            handholding. <br><br> 
            
            So, my first review of this book is “What the fuck did
            I just read?”. Reading this book is the equivalent of getting your
            balls squished, the pressure building and it’s uncomfortable but
            then at that one small interval it feels kind of nice, then it
            reverts to pain again. The world is deliberately made to be
            confusing, and I don’t have the rest of the books currently to
            become reasonably autistic enough to make an accurate statement on
            this heap of exposition. <br><br> 
            
            I suppose I could try to make sense of this
            book, but that would be the same as me trying to draw the whole
            story from fragments of a broken window. This book is the first in
            the series of ten whole books that are denser than a neutron star.
            So I am going to try to tell you what I’ve read, and I hope you
            don’t blow up. <br><br>
            
            The book is set in a war-ravaged world where peace
            seems distant and hate seems to be at the forefront of every
            conflict (much the same as our own world!) and it follows a wide
            range of characters. We have the group Bridgeburners, which are a
            specialized unit that is sent to major strategic places to disturb
            and destabilize the integrity of cities, most of the missions being
            a prep for war. Then we also have Tattersail, a mage that
            experiences the 9/11 equivalent of this book, then gets set out on a
            mission to be reborn back in time, are you following this so far?? <br><br>

            We also have a woman that works as a normal farmhand, gets possessed
            by a manifestation of death itself and then goes by a new name
            ‘Sorry’. <br><br>
            
            We also have Paran, who is the coolest dude in the book,
            the dude gets killed by an assassin, gets sent to the gate of hell,
            then comes back alive with the Luck of Oponn (which is another set
            of Gods). <br><br> 
            
            In this world, at this point in their time, humanity could
            rebel against and even kill gods. There are some things I also won’t
            say since that would spoil the book for you. If any of you poor sods
            want to actually read this fucking thing, I recommend it
            wholeheartedly, this book is very confusing the first time you read
            it but it also becomes one of the most interesting fantasy books out
            there. <br><br>
