            Warhammer 40K Battle Report: Indian Guard vs. Necrons – 500 Points,
            Kings of the Colosseum <br /><br />

            <i>By: Vore Vore</i> <br /><br />

            <b>Introduction</b> <br />

            In a grueling 500-point battle, the mighty Necrons led by
            marcellious. And the Depth Guard led by Elias, also known as the
            "Stink Guard," in a fight to dominate in Piriah Nexus. With both
            sides bringing powerful, yet contrasting forces to the table, it was
            a battle of slow but steady resilience versus calculated, relentless
            firepower. Here’s how the battle unfolded across five intense
            rounds. Armies Necrons – Awakened Dynasty <br /><br />

            Lokhust Lord (80 points) – Armed with the Staff of Light and the
            Erection Orb, this commander was ready to bolster the Necron forces
            and ensure they didn’t stay down for long. Skorpekh Lord (95 points)
            – Equipped with the Energetic Dermal Bond for added durability, he
            provided the muscle for his warriors. <br /><br />

            Troops: 5x Flayed Ones (60 points) – These savage creatures were set
            to tear into anything in their way. 5x Flayed Ones (60 points) –
            Another squad of the bloodthirsty Flayed Ones added extra board
            control. Elites: 3x Skorpekh Destroyers (90 points) – With high
            mobility and devastating melee, they were prepared to carve through
            anything in their path. Heavy Support: 2x Lokhust Heavy Destroyers
            (with Ementic Exterminator) – These devastating anti-tank weapons
            were ready to shred through armored units. <br /><br />

            Death Guard – Flyblown Host Noxious Brightbringer (90 points) Plague
            Surgeon (90 points) – Troops: 5x Plague Marines (60 points) – 5x
            Plague Marines (60 points) – Vehicles: 2x Crabs (60 points each)
            <br /><br />

            Deployment and Mission Objectives Mission: Main Objective: Burden of
            Trust Necrons (Attacker): Secondary: Cull the Horde Secondary: No
            Prisoners Death Guard (Defender): Secondary: Behind Enemy Lines
            Secondary: Engage on All Fronts Both armies prepared their forces
            for a slow burn of attrition, with the Death Guard on defense and
            the Necrons pushing aggressively. <br /><br />

            <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Round 1:</b> <br />

            Necrons <br />

            Movement: The Necron forces cautiously advanced, with the Lokhust
            Lord and Skorpekh Lord shifting into position. The Flayed Ones,
            however, seemed to stay a bit too far back. <br />

            Shooting: In a turn of missed opportunities, the Necrons failed to
            connect with any of their shots, and the Flayed Ones were still far
            from engaging the enemy. <br />

            Charge: The Death Guard advanced, and the Necrons attempted to
            charge but failed to make any impact. <br />

            Death Guard (0 VPs) Movement: The Plague Marines and Crabs shuffled
            forward at a lethargic pace, moving only a modest 5 inches – not the
            ideal pace to counteract the Necron's advancing forces. <br />

            Shooting: Despite the slow start, the Death Guard managed to toss a
            few grenades, though all shots missed their mark. <br />

            Charge: The Crabs engaged the Flayed Ones, cutting down three before
            a surprising move from Marcellious, using one Command Point to
            resurrect one Flayed One. <br /><br />

            <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Round 1.5</b> <br />

            Elias bought pancakes, and monster (of course) from the cafè for
            70kr. Café is open in the fellesrom from 9:30 to 12:10! <br /><br />

            <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Round 2</b> <br /><br />

            Necrons (5 VPs) <br /><br />

            Movement: The Skorpekh Lord and his squad surged forward, ready to
            wreak havoc on the Plague Marines. <br />

            Shooting: Nothing to report here – the Necrons struggled to land any
            significant shots. <br />

            Charge: The Necron charge was unsuccessful, and the Death Guard was
            able to weather the storm with their tough resilience. <br />

            Death Guard (0 VPs) <br /><br />

            Movement: The Plague Surgeon remained stationary. Was this a
            tactical error, or was he simply playing it safe? <br />

            Shooting: One wound was inflicted on a Lokhust Destroyer, but it
            wasn’t enough to kill it. <br />

            Charge: No significant charges took place this round. The Death
            Guard were starting to feel the pressure. <br /><br />

            <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Round 3</b> <br /><br />

            Necrons (15 VPs) <br />

            Movement: The backline Necron forces closed in, bringing their
            warriors into the fray. <br />

            Shooting: The Skorpekh Destroyers made their presence known, wiping
            out a full squad of Plague Marines with devastating firepower.
            <br />

            Charge: Despite a few attempts, none of the charges landed
            successfully. However, the Skorpekh Destroyers’ firepower was enough
            to decimate one of two Plague Marine squad’s. <br /><br />

            Death Guard (5 VPs) <br />

            Movement: The Plague Surgeon finally moved, closing in on charge
            range – but was it too little, too late? <br />

            Shooting: In another round of missed shots, the Death Guard were
            unable to hit anything. <br />

            Charge: Nothing ever came of the charges this round, with both sides
            essentially at a standstill. <br /><br />

            <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Round 4</b><br /><br />

            Necrons (10 VPs) <br />

            Movement: The Necron forces closed in. Everything was within
            engagement range now. <br />

            Shooting: Some shooting took place, but much of it fell short.
            However, in a shocking turn of events, the Crabs were finally wiped
            out by the concentrated firepower of the Necrons. <br />

            Charge: The Necrons moved into assault range, but they were still
            unable to capitalize on it. <br />

            Death Guard (10 VPs) <br />

            Movement: The Death Guard struggled to maintain their footing, and
            no major movements occurred. <br />

            Shooting: There was no significant output from the Death Guard this
            round. <br />

            Charge: The Death Guard did manage to eliminate a squad of Flayed
            Ones, but the battle was slipping away from them. <br /><br />

            <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Round 5</b> <br /><br />

            Necrons (40 VPs) <br />

            Movement: No movement, Locked in mortal combat. <br />

            Shooting: With devastating firepower, the Necrons laid waste to
            three Plague Marines. <br />

            Charge: We’re so back. The Plauge remaining plauge remains die.
            <br />

            Death Guard (20 VPs) <br />

            Movement & Shooting: There was little left for the Death Guard to
            do, with no meaningful shooting or movement. The Plague Marines
            could only stand their ground for so long. <br />

            Charge: The final remnants of the Death Guard’s forces tried to
            charge but were ultimately unsuccessful. <br /><br />

            Conclusion Victory to the Necrons! With a final score of 40 VPs to
            the Death Guard’s 20 VPs, the Necrons took the day in the Kings of
            the Colosseum match. <br />
            Despite the slow and steady approach of the Death Guard, the
            Necrons’ relentless firepower, combined with their ability to
            resurrect and reanimate fallen warriors, proved too much for the
            Stink Guard. <br />

            The Death Guard's slow pace and ineffective charges, compounded by
            missed shooting opportunities, left them unable to mount a
            meaningful defense as the Necrons closed in for the kill. <br />

            The Necron Awakened Dynasty has once again proven why they are one
            of the most fearsome forces in the galaxy, securing yet another
            victory in the endless war for dominance in the 41st millennium.
