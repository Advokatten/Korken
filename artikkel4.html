            Warhammer 40K Battle Report: Indian Guard vs. Necrons – 500 Points, Kings of the Colosseum 
            
            By: Vore Vore 
            
            Figur 
            
            Introduction 
            
            In a grueling 500-point battle, the mighty Necrons led by marcellious. And the Depth Guard led by Elias, also known as the "Stink Guard," in a fight to dominate in Piriah Nexus. With both sides bringing powerful, yet contrasting forces to the table, it was a battle of slow but steady resilience versus calculated, relentless firepower. Here’s how the battle unfolded across five intense rounds. 
            
            Figur 
            
            Armies 
            
            Necrons – Awakened Dynasty 
            
                Lokhust Lord (80 points) – Armed with the Staff of Light and the Erection Orb, this commander was ready to bolster the Necron forces and ensure they didn’t stay down for long. 
            
                Skorpekh Lord (95 points) – Equipped with the Energetic Dermal Bond for added durability, he provided the muscle for his warriors. 
            
                Troops:  
            
                5x Flayed Ones (60 points) – These savage creatures were set to tear into anything in their way. 
            
                5x Flayed Ones (60 points) – Another squad of the bloodthirsty Flayed Ones added extra board control. 
            
                Elites:  
            
                3x Skorpekh Destroyers (90 points) – With high mobility and devastating melee, they were prepared to carve through anything in their path. 
            
                Heavy Support:

            Death Guard – Flyblown Host 
            
                Noxious Brightbringer (90 points)

            Deployment and Mission Objectives 
            
            Mission: 
            
                Main Objective: Burden of Trust 
            
                Necrons (Attacker):  
            
                Secondary: Cull the Horde 
            
                Secondary: No Prisoners 
            
                Death Guard (Defender):  
            
                Secondary: Behind Enemy Lines 
            
                Secondary: Engage on All Fronts 
            
            Both armies prepared their forces for a slow burn of attrition, with the Death Guard on defense and the Necrons pushing aggressively. 
            
            Figur 
            
            Round 1: 
            
            Necrons 
            
                Movement: The Necron forces cautiously advanced, with the Lokhust Lord and Skorpekh Lord shifting into position. The Flayed Ones, however, seemed to stay a bit too far back. 
            
                Shooting: In a turn of missed opportunities, the Necrons failed to connect with any of their shots, and the Flayed Ones were still far from engaging the enemy. 
            
                Charge: The Death Guard advanced, and the Necrons attempted to charge but failed to make any impact. 
            
            Death Guard (0 VPs) 
            
                Movement: The Plague Marines and Crabs shuffled forward at a lethargic pace, moving only a modest 5 inches – not the ideal pace to counteract the Necron's advancing forces. 
            
                Shooting: Despite the slow start, the Death Guard managed to toss a few grenades, though all shots missed their mark. 
            
                Charge: The Crabs engaged the Flayed Ones, cutting down three before a surprising move from Marcellious, using one Command Point to resurrect one Flayed One.
